```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/Coursera/PracticalMachineLearning/CourseProject")
train <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", head=T)
test <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", head=T)
train2 <- train[,colSums(is.na(train)) == 0] 
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
